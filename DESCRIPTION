Package: RSQLiteVirtualTable
Title: Create virtual tables from R Objects that can be used directly in an SQLite database
Description: This is a mechanism to explore using virtual tables in SQLite from within R
  and providing the contents of an SQLite table via R objects, specifically, an R data frame.
  At its very simplest, this is a means of not having to explicitly import the data frame
  into SQLite (via INSERT commands or dumping it as a CSV file and then .import).
  Instead, we can take the data frame in memory in R and expose it as a table via
  an abstract interface that does not require an immediate copy of the data from R.
  This package aims to facilitate exploring the ideas. We can experiment with different
  indexing strategies, etc.
